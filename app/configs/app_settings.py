# A module is a .py file; executing `import module` runs all top-level code once.
# Python compiles and executes the module, initializing its namespace
# Imported modules are cached in sys.modules.
# Subsequent imports within the same interpreter reuse this cached module -> no re-execution (very important)
# If you import the same module in a different script/process, top-level code runs again (new sessionâ€™s cache is empty)

# throughout your entire project, no matter how many files do "from config import settings"
# that module (and Settings() initialization) only runs once per python execution process. Everything else uses the cached module and settings instance.
